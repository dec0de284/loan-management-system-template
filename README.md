# Loan Management System Template
An loan management system. Still in development and work in progress.
Might contain bugs if used.

# Project Goals
- [ ] Release a Loan Management System Template for the General Public
- [ ] Make less restrictions
  - **Currently, this build:**
    - Uses Third-party Report Forms known as **Crystal Report**
      - [ ] Find an alternative open-source report form, preferably under [CC0-1.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
    - Uses Third-party Database known as **Microsoft Access**
      - [ ] Find an alternative open-source database file creator, preferably under [CC0-1.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
- [ ] Add online database availability
# Warnings
- Using Crystal Report 64-bit will not work properly with the 32-bit Microsoft Access Database. It's either you have to downgrade to Crystal Report 32-bit or upgrade your Microsoft Office to 64-bit.
# Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 (Any edition)
  - You could use higher versions of Visual Studio, but you have to also install Visual Studio 2019 because it's a requirement of **Crystal Report**.
  - If you used higher versions of Visual Studio, you have to download both versions of **Crystal Report**, **SP33 32b** and SP33 64b**.
- If you will use the Microsoft Access Database included in this repository,
  - you'll have to download [Crystal Report for Visual Studio SP33 32b (VS 2019 and below)](https://origin.softwaredownloads.sap.com/public/site/index.html).
- else, create the database manually.
